# Squiggly Checker
## What is it?
This useful piece of code is able to figure out if an input is a "~" or anything else. When may this be useful? I don't know.

## How to run
This code will run on any SPL (Shakespeare Programming Language) translator. To find out more about SPL, the website is here http://shakespearelang.com/ 
The specific translator I used was https://github.com/zmbc/shakespearelang

Have fun..
